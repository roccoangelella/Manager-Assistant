## Prompt #1:
    Analyze the company quality control status. What can you find out?

### RAG System Output:
    The company quality control data shows that non-conformity costs (NC Cost) have a high degree of variability, with some instances costing significantly more than others, as indicated by a standard deviation of 251.50 and a mean of 165.24.
    Most non-conformities have no costs recorded.
    Audit scores have a moderate variability.
    A histogram of NC Cost has been generated.
    Further analysis could focus on the causes of high NC Costs and the relationship between audit scores and NC Cost.

### Gemini 2.0 Flash Output:
    Overall, the extensive and diverse nature of non-conformities strongly suggests that the company’s current quality control measures are insufficient.
    This could lead to increased operational costs (due to rework, scrap, and warranty claims), decreased customer satisfaction, damage to brand reputation, and potential regulatory issues.
    To improve, the company needs to conduct a thorough root cause analysis for each type of non-conformity and implement robust corrective and preventive actions across its entire quality management system.
