### RAG System Output:

The essence of CASE-ARIA's Quality Assurance (QA) philosophy, beyond compliance, consistency, and competitiveness, lies in the quality culture fostered among employees. This culture emphasizes the integration of scientific rigor, regulatory compliance, cultural heritage, and strategic foresight to build trust, safeguard public health, ensure long-term viability, and deliver on a promise of excellence. It is not merely about detecting faults.

This quality culture is fostered among employees through:

Training and Development: Programs that ensure staff understand and internalize QA principles.
Cross-functional Collaboration: Encouraging teamwork between QA, R&D, production, logistics, and sales to ensure quality is considered in every decision.
Employee Empowerment: Encouraging staff at all levels to report issues, suggest improvements, and take ownership of quality outcomes.
Leadership Commitment: Actively involving senior management in QA reviews, audits, and strategy setting.
Internal Audits: Reinforce a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.
